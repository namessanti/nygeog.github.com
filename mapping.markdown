#*More mapping examples-upcoming-need to add links*

I'll be adding more mapping examples over the next few weeks/months. Some projects and maps I've created are [HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/) or [IRB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board) sensitive and can not be shared.
