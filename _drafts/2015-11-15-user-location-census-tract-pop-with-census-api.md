For a few weeks I've been thinking about combining a few API's and services to create a pretty simple page that can:

1. Get user location (lat/lng).
2. Get Census Tract (2010) of user location (lat/lng intersects Geoid).
3. Then get some variable, such as population (P0010001), from the [US Census API](http://nygeog.github.io/maps/censustract2010locator/).



**User and App or Browser must approve Location**
