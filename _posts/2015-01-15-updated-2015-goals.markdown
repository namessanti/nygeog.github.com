### Updated and Additional 2015 Goals
* Write out more goals! It seems like when I write the stuff down I actually end up following through. 

* Try out [Python for Processing 2.0](http://py.processing.org/)

* Do more stuff in [R with ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) and maybe [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). 


* Javascript Goals
	* Learn [CartoDB.js](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform/cartodb-js.html)
	* Make good slide show frame using Javascript
		[SlidesJS](http://www.slidesjs.com/). I couldn't manage to get this to work on Chrome at all so I ended up changing my forwarding to HTTP from HTTPS. I'm not totally sure what the consequences of this will be, but figure since I don't engage in any commerce here it should be all right.
