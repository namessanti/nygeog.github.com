<!--Ok great. What other tools were you thinking about? Just asking to make sure I didn't cover them

Catie, just confirming that I’ll be around and am able to do the talk Jan 9th. 

Should I give an overview of some of the other tools they could use for mapping and viz as well?

Well I didn't even know there was a difference between processing and processing.js. so maybe you could explain that difference as well, if it's important.

The students will have computers and can follow along if you prefer. But if it requires downloading any software they don't already have I would maybe skip the following along part, unless them taking 10 minutes to download something is ok.

This lecture is for a class on data visualization in SAS. But I also introduce other software and tools that they can use. Gina gave a guest lecture talking about the importance of data viz in her research and showed animated maps you created. The students loved the maps and wanted to just hear about processing and what is required/necessary to make maps in processing.

Disclaimer: I really only know some of the Processing application, not processing.js. Is this for a class, workshop or something else? Will the students have computers and work along? 

I’m 85% sure I can do it, I just need to see how some January travel plans pan out. I’ll put it in my calendar and plan for it.

Hi Danny,

Would you be interested and have time to give a 30-45 minute lecture on processing.js. Mostly just an overview of what it is, what us required to make maps in processing (code and/or data manipulation) as well as some examples, on Friday January 9th at 11 am?
