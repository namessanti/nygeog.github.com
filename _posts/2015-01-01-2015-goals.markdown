#####This is a list of Goals of what I would like to achieve in 2015. 

##1. Open Source GIS as default
From now on my rule-of-thumb will be to attempt to geoprocess using open source tools rather than using an Esri solution as default.

##2. PostGIS
Probably the biggest initial hindrance of PostGIS is deciding which version to install. Once I get past those hurdles and have a reliable install of PostGIS I think I'll be ready to roll. I have been using a ton of GDAL/OGR tools lately so I'm really looking forward to the efficiencies of doing more work in PostGIS.

##3. Personal Website updates
Rebuild the personal website. Include mapping examples (even some static ones) as I don't have much of an organized web portfolio. 

##4. Rolling out a Jekyll Bootstrap site*
I was just dabbling with jekyll bootstrap again recently and I forgot how easy it is to use. I haven't actually done anything in production with it but feel like it would be great to. 

\* This could be achieved in rolling out updates to my personal website.

##5. Use CartoDB more
CartoDB just opened their US office a few blocks from my home in Brooklyn so there's really no excuse for me to not be using their products more. They've also made the default academic accounts much larger for storage.

##6. Blog more*
I'd like to increase the frequency with which I blog. It's useful for me to document things I've learned. 

\* This could be achieved in lock step with using Jekyll
