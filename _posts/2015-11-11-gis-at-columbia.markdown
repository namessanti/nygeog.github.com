Due to time constraints and becoming a [data science student](http://datascience.columbia.edu/) I haven't taught a GIS course in a while and lost my bearing on what is offered and who teaches GIS at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/). However, I often get asked about GIS courses and resources at Columbia University. A couple of grad students who took my intro GIS course a few years back inspired this post. 

*Disclaimer: this post is not sanctioned by Columbia University, nor is it being delivered in any way affiliated with my employment at Columbia University. The only benefit of this post for me is that I can direct folks who inquire about GIS at Columbia to this post rather than reusing email text.*
