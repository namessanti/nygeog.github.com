I've been challenged throughout my algorithms for data science class. This last homework (HW4) we studied and programmed NP Complete Problems and used [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) and [PuLP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PuLP) so I thought I'd share a few resources that were helpful for that assignment.

Topic 24 C: NP Complete Problems
We illustrate the range of NP Complete problems and how they are shown to be NPC by sketching proofs for several problems in logic, graph theory, and arithmetic. 
Lecture by Dan Suthers for University of Hawaii Information and Computer Sciences course 311 on Algorithms. (Inverted course: lectures are online and problem solving in class.) 
Based on Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein, Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition, The MIT Press, 2009.
