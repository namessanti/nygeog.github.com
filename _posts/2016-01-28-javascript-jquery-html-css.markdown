As part of of my post **[2016 Goals for GIS, web and myself](http://nygeog.github.io/2016/goals/2016/01/07/2016-goals.html)**, I mentioned learning some fundamentals on JavaScript. 

>1. Learn more fundamentals and take a class in **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)**, perhaps at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) or elsewhere. More and more of geospatial is moving towards the web. While I think I've gotten a good handle on Python (Esri and FOSS4G) for GIS on the desktop, I really need to get more into web programming. And rather than concatenatively learning JavaScript, perhaps it'd be worthwhile to learn it in a classroom from an expert. 

Ideally, I'd like to take a class, but right now I'm in the midst of [Machine Learning class at Columbia Data Science](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/coms4721-s16/) and missed a few classes due to being stuck traveling during the late January winter storm in New York City. However, I have started on the **JavaScript & jQuery** book and find the design and simplicity of the **[@wagonbooks](https://twitter.com/wagonbooks)** to help with learning in a way that sometimes online documentation does not. Author **Jon Duckett** has conveys a  visual understanding of programming that I have not seen elsewhere.

*[Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118907442?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00) - $34 (each book is almost $30 on its own, so $34 is a steal)*

>This two-book set combines the titles HTML & CSS: Designing and Building Web Sites and JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Development.

*The books feature easy to read graphics and images that nicely explain the code and the concepts.*
