Date: 2014-12-04 22:02 

Jeff F. ( aka [@zingbot](https://twitter.com/zingbot)) gave a solid presentation during the [@MaptimeNYC](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-NYC/) session last night. The Maptime was at [CartoDB's](http://cartodb.com/) Williamsburg, Brooklyn office. 

Below are my notes:

##MaptimeNYC's SQL for CartoDB

####Creating Lines from Points
#####ST_Makeline

	SELECT ST_MakeLine (the_geom_webmercator ORDER BY _order ASC)
	AS the_geom_webmercator, route
	FROM maptimesql_points
	GROUP BY route

#####ST_Contains (Spatial Join)
	SELECT 
	us_counties.the_geom_webmercator,us_counties.cartodb_id, count(quakes.the_geom)
	AS total
	FROM us_counties JOIN quakes
	ON st_contains(us_counties.the_geom,quakes.the_geom)
	GROUP BY us_counties.cartodb_id
	
####CDB_LatLng

	SELECT * FROM table 
	ORDER BY the_geom <->
	CDB_LatLng(42.5,-73) LIMIT 10
	
	#In POSTGIS it is the command ST_Point	
	
Check out ST_BUFFER (METERS) search it'll do the DIST or BUFFER in Meters


####lag()

Access the previous row of data and get value (time, value,number,etc)
