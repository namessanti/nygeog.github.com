This new website/blog is proof that I completed one of my 2015 goals.

I followed the simple instructions at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) and had a blog/website up in minutes. Uploading the site to GitHub was easy as well. 

Here's a screenshot from **jekyllrb** that shows four (4) steps to get started.
