#Thoughts from State of the Map US (#SOTMUS) Post 1 

The first weekend of June ~850 people attended the [State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us/) (SOTMUS) conference at the United Nations in New York City, NY. The conference is centered around a global mapping dataset called [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM).

I went to SOTMUS 2014 in Washington, D.C. and thought the sessions and community were great. So I was looking forward to attending the event again in 2015. The cost was pretty cheap as far as conferences were concerned and I live in New York City so I ended up bypassing expensing the event through work and paid the $90 early bird registration fee.
