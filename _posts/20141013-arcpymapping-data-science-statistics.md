Title: What I've been up to...
<!--arpy.mapping, fiona, shapely-->
##What's going on!
Been working a lot and taking a course in Probability and Statistics at Columbia University IDSE. 

I hope to get some posts continuing my work with <strong>Fiona</strong> and <strong>Shapely</strong>. Also, I had to do some automated mapping where I leveraged some of the great tools that the <strong>arcpy.mapping</strong> allows for.
