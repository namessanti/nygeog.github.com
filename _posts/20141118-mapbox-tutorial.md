Title: Mapbox Source Quickstart

While I have a ton of Python and other desktop-related stuff going on (also following up on Eric Thiese's GeoStack demo, more on that later on), two nights ago I took a quick digression into doing the [Mapbox Source Quickstart](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/source-quickstart/). While I've done a few of the Mapbox and TileMill exercises before this was one of the first I followed through with the directions exactly and all the way to the end. 

###Mapbox Example

Some of the steps were a little confusing as I think Mapbox Studio's interface has slightly changed (or some of the buttons look different on my computer) but overall it was a very easy demo. I highly suggest folks to check it out. Also, if you have any questions hit me up.
