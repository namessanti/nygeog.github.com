Recently, I had to compete in a Kaggle competition for our [Machine Learning for Data Science course at Columbia University](http://datascience.columbia.edu/). I used [Sci-Kit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and some Python coding to execute my algorithm. I thought I'd share a diagram to illustrate the steps executed and the paper writeup.
